One of my [buddies](https://linktr.ee/lupin.lo0ps) recently expressed interest in this game called [Dispatch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/), it's a telltale-esque game where you run some washed up superheroes through silly scenarios, all the while trying to become not washed up anymore. Also the guy you play is "Robert Robertson III" which is so funny. The game is good and you should buy it.

Anyways, from that fun romp with the game, I heard my friend had interest in it and I purchased it as payment for a commission. Here it is!

I'll be updating this soon with an image caption, but if you like this art please checkout my friend's [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/lupin.lo0ps) for more of their art! 

Thanks Nat!
