Hey! It hasn't been that long suprisingly. 

I recently visited my uni's martial arts club. I had a ton of fun. I didn't know what I was doing but I definitely enjoyed 90% of it, the other 10% was just neutral. It's mainly [Muay Thai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muay_Thai) focused but they do a bit of [Taekwondo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo) as well. I don't know much if anything about martial arts so I learned some of the basics. Jab, cross, teep, roundhouse, and I tried learning a hook kick and am just not there yet. I haven't sparred yet but I'm very excited to. I took some vids of everyone sparring and won't post them but once I do start sparring I'll post it. Overall 10/10 for an introduction to [the art of eight limbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muay_Thai).
