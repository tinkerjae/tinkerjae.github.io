Hey guys! Welcome to 2026!

This one's gotta be another quick one but I've been working on this as of late.
I often struggle with writing down song ideas as I have them, and this makes the process of music creation really difficult.
To combat this, I've got a little method of writing down ideas now.

Basic Song Drafting:
1. Rhythm + Tempo
2. Melody + Harmony
3. Song Structure
Intermediate Song Drafting:
4. Timbre + Texture
5. Dynamics + Articulation
6. Style/Vibe
Advanced Song Drafting:
7. Concept/Story/Narrative
8. Song Write Up
9. Lyrics if wanted

I'll see how well this works and hopefully will do more with this soon.
Bye for now!
