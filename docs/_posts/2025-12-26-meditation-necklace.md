Hello all! 

This one's a quick one because I don't have much energy to post right now but I made a necklace. This one is made from hardware store parts because they're easy to get and represent what I like. It's got 3 hex nuts because 3 is my favorite number, and it's size adjustable. 

If you want to make your own, the nuts are  1/2" stainless steel and I don't know what size the paracord is. The knots I used were the [double fisherman's knot](https://www.animatedknots.com/double-fishermans-bend-knot) for the adjustable feature, and the [figure 8 knot](https://www.animatedknots.com/figure-8-knot) for keeping the nuts in place. The nuts are supposed to be heavy to remind me to meditate. It's also a great prayer tool. 

Anyway, here are some photos:

Alright, that's it from me. Bye for now!
