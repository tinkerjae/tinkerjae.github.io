My website has been *refreshed*, I've added a bunch of new features and revamped some old ones.
1. Added an [open source/attributions](/open-source/) page.
2. Cleaned up my [homepage](/).
3. Updated the [posts](/all-posts/) logic to now have [pagination](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2) and [autopages](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2/blob/master/README-AUTOPAGES.md) for each category and tag on the site.
4. Finally started using [includes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/) and cleaned up some of the posts/metadata logic for posts and pages.
5. Deleted some old redundant pages.
6. Changed my website's main [font](https://github.com/BlackFoundryCom/InriaFonts) to finally be good and readable.
7. Improved mobile support and formatting.
8. Consolidated my [RSS/Atom](/rss-atom/) feeds.
9. Updated my backend workflow to support Jekyll {{jekyll.version}} and plugins.
10. Actually put stuff on my [about](/about/) page!

And probably some other stuff I forgot to mention. Most of this stuff has been on the backburner for a long time, I'm really happy to finally go through with it!
