How ya going?

Still on my silly journey to be happy. I've decided I want to post on the internet about my journey with school as someone who's not super mega rich, and also neurodivergent. If you don't know, I've got ADHD, it makes school and life really hard so I use lots of tools. I have an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault with over 1300 files in it, along with several journals. I meditate, I exercise, I sleep well, etc. I've tried using a lot of natural methods to help curb the negative symptoms of ADHD, but it's not enough. I'm currently pursuing an ADHD diagnosis as a 20 year old adult. I am male so my chances are much higher of the doctor taking me seriously, but it's never a good experience to have the fate of your future in the neurotypical world determined by someone who can dismiss your concerns, especially for females. Nonetheless, I'm sure it'll go well, and if it won't I will keep on moving. Funny isn't it, one thing I think my ADHD has given me is the ability to keep trying, even though it doesn't work 99.9999% of the time.

But yeah as of right now I've just received news that my most recent Calculus 2 test flopped. 53/100, though I did score a 94/100 on the one before that so not all hope is lost. I feel I just didn't prepare properly, I'll try something different for the next test and here it is so far. I'm journaling and publishing my journey with school on the internet.

I'm also trying to prioritize happiness for myself. Right now it seems that publishing:

1. My journey with school.
2. Me doing/making more projects
3. And my learning of new skills.

is what makes me happy. Until this next test I'm going to try to prioritize treating school as an enjoyable experience. I want to enjoy school, and it helps that if I don't enjoy it I act like a kid being fed vegetables. I'm serious about that too, it's like my body rejects anything if I try too hard to like it or be good at it. For more on that phenomena look into [executive dysfunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_dysfunction).

My current idea is to treat school as a hobby, to try to enjoy it more than anything. And when I feel I'm done, I'm done. Doesn't matter if there's an assignment, I'd rather sacrifice a little short term productivity, for long term continuation of something I want to do. Today I'm going to rep out some Calc 2 Homework, as well as a MATLAB Assignment. But yeah, that's all for today, see ya later!
