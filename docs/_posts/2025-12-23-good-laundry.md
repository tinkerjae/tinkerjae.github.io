Today has been rough. 

I'm not sure if there's something in the air but today has been pretty crappy. 
I spent about 4x the amount of time I should've putting together a bed frame after wasting my morning.
Then I realized the bed frame doesn't account for my mattress' box spring so now I have to figure out how to dispose of that.
Then I took an accidental nap and wasted another few hours being overstimulated.

But after a while things started to turn around.
I got to do some laundry at a new laundromat, that was nice.
I got to enjoy some peace and quiet in that laundromat.
And randomly I figured out a fix for some old not working bluetooth earbuds so they're working again!
Today was bad, now it's not so bad. I'm grateful.

Per audacia ad astra, thanks for reading.
