A fresh start.

Welcome all to my new website! This is my first official post, glad you're reading it. I'm planning a lot of things for this site, so stay tuned. For now I thought I'd kill two birds with one stone. This website is currently what's known as a [tabula rasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_rasa) or blank slate. I don't plan on adding much in terms of old content as that will stay on the [old site](https://tinkerjae.neocities.org/) but there will be new stuff coming soon. 

The next things I need to work on are:
1. Adding categories for posts and sectioning them off.
2. Fleshing out the website by posting more stuff.
3. Adding a more realized about page.
4. Adding a more realized home page.
5. Giving the old site a warning label that I'm moving to this url for good.

That's all for now, tata!
