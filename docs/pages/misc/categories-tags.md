# 'Strict' Categories
blog: General posts about my life.

projects: stuff I'm working on specifically over time.

hobbies: like blog posts but specifically in relation to my hobbies, like if I ever make posts about parkour or mma or something.

misc: As of right now this is only specific pages I make, but might apply to blog posts later on for stuff that fits really nowhere else and doesn't really need it's own category.
