## Website Info
My website is open source and the [source code](https://github.com/tinkerjae/tinkerjae.github.io) is public @ the previous link.
My website is running [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) {{jekyll.version}}, with the [jekyll-feed](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed) and [jekyll-paginate-v2](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2) plugins being used for Atom/RSS feed generation, as well as pagination + the autopages feature for categories and tags. My website is hosted through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with a custom domain via [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). All of my photos, images, and non embeded media are hosted at [Catbox.moe](https://catbox.moe/).

## Development Process
My dev process is different than others because I'm running plugins that [GH Pages](https://pages.github.com/) doesn't support natively. I edit/modify my [source branch](https://github.com/tinkerjae/tinkerjae.github.io/tree/source) to modify the website in any capacity, but the changes only show once I upload the raw html, css, and other '_site' files to the [static-files branch](https://github.com/tinkerjae/tinkerjae.github.io/tree/static-files). 
The [static-files](https://github.com/tinkerjae/tinkerjae.github.io/tree/static-files) are what actually show up on the website where as the [source](https://github.com/tinkerjae/tinkerjae.github.io/tree/source) files exist on the backend.
