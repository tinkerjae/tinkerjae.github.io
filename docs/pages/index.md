Hi! Welcome to my new site! This website is currently a work in progress, 
I'm porting some of this website over from my [former site](https://tinkerjae.neocities.org/). 

This website exists as my personal home on the internet where I can post about my [daily life](/blog/), [projects](/projects/), weird opinions, poetry, and cool stuff I've found on the internet. 

If you'd like to make a website like this, check out my [resources page](/webresources/).
<hr>
<h1><u>Sitemap</u></h1>
[Home](/): This page. <br>
[Posts](/posts/): All of my posts in chronological order. <br>
[Categories](/categories/): My posts divided into different categories. <br>
[Misc](/misc/): For stuff that doesn't quite fit anywhere else.
