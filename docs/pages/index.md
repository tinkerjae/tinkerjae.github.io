Hi! Welcome to my new site! 

This website is always a work in progress. 
This website exists as my personal home on the internet where I post about my daily life, [projects](/project/), [hobbies](/all-posts/martial-arts/), poetry, and cool stuff I've found on the internet. 

If you'd like to make a website like this, check out my [web dev resources](/web-dev-resources/).

Oh and this website is [open source](/open-source/), feel free to take a peek at my [source code](https://github.com/tinkerjae/tinkerjae.github.io)!
