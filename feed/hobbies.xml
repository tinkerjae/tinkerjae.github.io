It hasn’t been that long suprisingly.</p>

<p>I recently visited my uni’s martial arts club. I had a ton of fun. I didn’t know what I was doing but I definitely enjoyed 90% of it, the other 10% was just neutral. It’s mainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muay_Thai">Muay Thai</a> focused but they do a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo">Taekwondo</a> as well. I don’t know much if anything about martial arts so I learned some of the basics. Jab, cross, teep, roundhouse, and I tried learning a hook kick and am just not there yet. I haven’t sparred yet but I’m very excited to. I took some vids of everyone sparring and won’t post them but once I do start sparring I’ll post it. Overall 10/10 for an introduction to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muay_Thai">the art of eight limbs</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Jae</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="hobbies" /><category term="martial-arts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
