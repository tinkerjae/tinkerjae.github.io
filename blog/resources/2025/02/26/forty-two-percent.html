<p>A writing on rest.</p>

<p>I’ve been very burnt out as of late, it’s been pretty bad and I want it to get better. I’m trying really hard to keep my shit together but it ain’t easy. I found <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/cookiedoughmeagain/663232885726281728/youreastargirl-cookiedoughmeagain">this tumblr post</a> via pinterest and I thought I’d save it here for future safekeeping and share it with the internet while I’m at it.</p>

<p>The first big thing is this:
<img alt="Forty-Two_Percent_From_Burnout_Solve_Your_Stress_Cycle_By_Emily&amp;Amelia_Nagoski" src="https://files.catbox.moe/d4iqhq.jpg" width="500" /></p>

<p>You need a minimum of at least 42% rest, that is not a suggestion, that is a requirement. If that requirement isn’t met upfront it will come back to haunt you. I say this to mean, if you don’t treat yourself right the universe will force you to until it starts to kill you slowly then all at once.</p>

<p>This only further forces the point, that people can only do what they can do. If pushed to their limit they will struggle, and beyond that you will be crushed under your own weight. Not to be dramatic, but that’s not good.</p>

<p>So what does this mean for you or I? It means TAKE A GOD DAMN BREAK! There are too many self righteous people (me included) that will work till they fall apart and this I’m here to remind both you and myself that you have limits. Stretch them, sure, but breaking your limits breaks you, and not only is it not a good idea ethically, morally, or spiritually, but for the sake of efficiency there is no point to do it that way. Get comfortable with where you are, for even as you are, you are great.</p>

<p>Furthermore, what is rest? If we’re gonna do that let’s do it well enough. Well it’s many things, but it ain’t just sleep.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sleep</li>
  <li>Meditation</li>
  <li>Meaningful conversation with someone you have a connection with</li>
  <li>Exercising</li>
  <li>Paying attention to your food, whether that’s shopping for it, cooking it or eating it</li>
  <li>Socialising</li>
  <li>Daydreaming</li>
  <li>Joy</li>
  <li>Whimsy</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all valid forms of rest. When getting your 42%, treat it like food, get a wide variety to cover your bases, and trust your gut.</p>

<p>TL:DR; Please rest, do so well, and take care of yourself. It’s not only good for the soul, but actually neccessary for your body and productivity as well. Now I’m gonna get to bed as it’s currently 9:45pm EST.</p>
