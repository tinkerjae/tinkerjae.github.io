Making this to track my current categories.
category: '1' Means that it's going to go under the categories page.
Posts is all of our posts in the '_posts' folder
## general categories
Blog: General posts about my life.
Projects: stuff I'm working on specifically over time.
Hobbies: like blog posts but specifically in relation to my hobbies, like if I ever make posts about parkour or mma or something.
Misc: As of right now this is only specific pages I make, but might apply to blog posts later on for stuff that fits really nowhere else and doesn't really need it's own category.
## Potential categories
Stuff I've already added to certain posts but haven't implemented fully
Resources: useful things I'm saving for later for myself or others.
Vent: Dramatic wah wah wah posts about my life.
